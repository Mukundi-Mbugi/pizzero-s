## BDD
Some special features have been deployed in this web page to improve the user experience. The home page has a button that leads the user to the menu. The menu page too has a button lading the user to the place order page. The place order page has a price table for all prices offered. The user is able to choose the pizza of their preference as guided and are notified of their total price. He/she is presented with the option to choose wether to have the pizza delivered or not.
They are then thanked after the purchase is successful.
